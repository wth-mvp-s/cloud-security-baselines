# 03 – Legal / DPO Procedure

## 1. Purpose
Define the legal and regulatory steps to be taken following the loss or theft of a mobile device used for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), in order to comply with GDPR and CNIL requirements.

---

## 2. Immediate Actions
- [ ] Confirm with IT/Security that the incident has been contained (revocation, reset, traceability).  
- [ ] Open a **Data Breach Record** in the internal register of processing activities (Art. 30 RGPD).  
- [ ] Evaluate whether the incident qualifies as a **personal data breach** under GDPR.  

---

## 3. Breach Assessment
Criteria to assess the breach (Art. 33 & 34 GDPR):  
- Nature of the data involved (identifiers, authentication factors).  
- Circumstances of the incident (lost vs. stolen).  
- Likelihood of unauthorized access to personal data.  
- Potential impact on rights and freedoms of data subjects.  

If risk is **unlikely** → record internally only.  
If risk is **likely** → notify CNIL (Art. 33).  
If risk is **high** → notify CNIL + inform data subjects (Art. 34).

## 4. Notification to CNIL
- Use template **Annex B**.  
- Deadline: **72 hours** after becoming aware of the incident.  
- Include: description of incident, categories of data, persons affected, consequences, mitigation measures.  
- Keep proof of notification (acknowledgement of receipt, case number).  

---

## 5. Notification to Data Subjects
- Use template **Annex C**.  
- Send without undue delay if risk is **high**.  
- Communication must be clear, plain language, and indicate contact point for questions.  

---

## 6. Documentation & Traceability
- Log the incident in the **Data Breach Register** (Art. 33(5) GDPR).  
- Store evidence: IT report, timeline, decision matrix, CNIL notification, client letter.  
- Maintain confidentiality of records (restricted access: Legal/DPO, CISO).  

---

## 7. Escalation / Validation
